This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who want to create a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a .NET application in their AWS environment using the AWS portfolio of DevOps services. This Quick Start follows best practices to create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys a .NET application to Fargate. You can use this Quick Start as both a reference architecture and a template for creating a fully implemented CI/CD pipeline for deploying a .NET application to Fargate. To deploy the application to Fargate, you upload the application's source code to the code repository created by the Quick Start.
