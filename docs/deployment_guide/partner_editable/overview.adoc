This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Partner Solution reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Partner Solution is for users who want to create a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a .NET application in their AWS environment using the AWS portfolio of DevOps services. This Partner Solution follows best practices to create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys a .NET application to Fargate. You can use this Partner Solution as both a reference architecture and a template for creating a fully implemented CI/CD pipeline for deploying a .NET application to Fargate. To deploy the application to Fargate, you upload the application's source code to the code repository created by the Partner Solution.

Even though this Partner Solution provides the required steps to deploy containerized applications to Fargate, you should be familiar with https://dotnet.microsoft.com/[.NET^] and how to build containerized applications using https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/[Docker multi-stage builds^].
